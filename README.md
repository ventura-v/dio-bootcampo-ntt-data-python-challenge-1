# Challenge 1 - Make a bank system using Python
First challenge of DIO Bootcamp with NTT Data

## The Rules:

### Deposit Operation
It should be possible to deposit positive amounts into the bank account. V.1 of the project works with only one user, so it is not necessary identify the agency or account number. All deposits should be stored in a variable and displayed in the account statement operation.

### Withdrawal Operation
The system should allow up to 3 daily withdrawals with a maximum limit of R$ 500.00 per withdrawal. If the user does not have enough balance, the system should display a message indicating that the withdrawal can not be completed due to insufficient funds. All withdrawals should be stored in a variable and displayed in the account statement operation.

### Account Statement Operation
This operation should list all deposits and withdrawals made on the account. At the end of the listing, the current account balance should be displayed.
Values should be displayed in the format R$ xxx.xx, e.g., 1500.45 = R$ 1500.45
